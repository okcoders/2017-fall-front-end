## React seed

Anytime we want to do anything with react, we will start with the
(create-react-app)[https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app] seed code

Seed code is a bunch of boilerplate we need to have a good working dev
environment, and one that can be deployed to production environments. 

doing (after installing following the instructions in the above link)
```
create-react-app my-new-project
```

will create a new folder with the boilerplate and dependencies needed to get
started with a new react project.

simply running ``` npm start``` inside the new folder will launch your
application in development mode.
