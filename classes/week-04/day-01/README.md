# React Router

One thing that is interesting about react compared to say angular, is that react
doesn't provide some basic things SPA (single page applications) need. The one
today we will talk about is routing. I guess needing routing isn't true, you can
certainly have an app that does not use routes, but thing about the back bar in
your browser, or bookmarks, or sharing links, or refreshing the page without
changes in the address bar (which is what "routing" handles).

Since react doesn't have routing out of the box, 3rd party libraries step up to
solve the problem. The current state of routing with redux is a complete mess,
and there are a couple libraries competing to solve that problem, but we aren't
dealing with redux at the moment. In our current state, [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) is a
popular choice,
