# 2017-fall-front-end
Code and lessons from 2017 fall intermediate front-end course

## Why this course

All of our courses have been introductions - this is our first intermediate
offering, with a focus on front-end web development using React. There are
hundreds of online courses covering React, this one will be like those in terms
of material. What is different is our focus on real-world projects that have
been sourced from the community. Students can decide to work on their own
project or work on a team that will be tackling one of the community sourced
projects. Either way, when taking this course you should get exposure to what it is like to
have a product manager and a team to work with all while having instructors and
mentors available to help.

### Resources

If you do a google search for "learn react" there is a ton out there. How do you
choose amongst all the options? Personally I suggest going through the free
online [docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html), if you want something more, just choose one of the cheap courses
out there, I've taken the udemy one below, but that doesn't mean it is the best
